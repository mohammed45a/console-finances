# Console Finances Module Challenge 4

## Description
In this challenge, the task was to use javascript to gtransform an array of information into relevant information that was used to make a calculation on the console. The task was to create code to help analyse financial records of a company. It allowed me to utilise and practice with a recently learned skill. I found it difficult when trying to understand JS in the lessons but some self-help after the lessons helped out a lot. Still need to do some more work on understanding the basics of JS more so it becomes familiar.
